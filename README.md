# sending-of-coursework
This is a coursework submission system
 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Server : XAMPP, WAMP, OpenServer, Denver

IDE : PhpStorm ( or your favorite text editor )

### Installing

Install Server which you chouse. In my case XAMPP.

Dowonload XAMPP from  https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html And install where you whant.

Clone progect in XAMPP -> htdocs folder

Open PhpMyAdmin by typing localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser and create a database called sendcoursworksite. Or you can use your database, but in this case you must set the database name in db.php.

You do not need to create tables in the database. After you register, a table of users will be created with rows, and when you add your first coursework, a table of corseworks will be created automatically.
